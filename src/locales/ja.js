These nodes are substantially less expensive to produce, acquire and operate than any traditional miner used for Bitcoin or Ethereum. Obelisk was designed to be a scalable, computationally-inexpensive, zero-waste alternative to PoW.

At Skycoin, we believe strongly in this mission. That’s why the Skycoin blockchain is designed to benefit all users, not just a select few.

Blockchain networks were intended to democratize finance, eliminating corporate control and spreading power among users. However, Bitcoin and related currencies have become centralized due to their reliance on Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithms, as well as their use of mining to create coins. This centralization defeats the original purpose of digital currencies.',

It also fixes security problems associated with other blockchain networks and decouples coin creation from the mining process. The result is a fully decentralized cryptocurrency that fulfills Satoshi’s original vision.',

Coin creation doesn’t give certain users disproportionate control over the network. The supply of Skycoin is fixed. Skycoin transactions occur in seconds and are more secure.

We are doing this by providing a decentralized community-driven mesh network where users  themselves will own and control the network’s infrastructure. Our goal is to provide everyone with access  to fast, secure, private and reliable internet.',

Customers routinely have their browsing data tracked, stored  and sold by ISPs, and at the same time experience unreliable coverage and poor customer service.  Instead of relying on corporate-owned networks, the Skywire mesh network runs on widespread  user-owned nodes which come together to provide the infrastructure for the network,  allowing  communities to power their internet access.',

      quote: '“Skycoin’s Fiber architecture is a transformational, better-than-blockchain solution which solves existing problems using distributed ledger technology. Fiber is the foundation of blockchain 3.0 and can be best described as an infinitely scalable network of blockchains laid side by side, like strands. This is a technological feat that cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum will never be able to achieve, as they were never engineered to scale infinitely.”',

      paragraph1: 'Fiber is the structural layer of Skycoin’s blockchain platform that is custom built to be adaptable to any blockchain application’s needs.  Running on an innovative and extremely efficient code, Fiber enables the Skycoin platform to scale into and disrupt veritably every industry with blockchain solutions.',

        text: 'Skycoin’s Fiber architecture enables scaling of the Skycoin platform laterally as well as vertically without compromising dependencies or network deficiencies at scale.  Thanks to Skycoin’s <a href="https://medium.com/skycoin/skycoin-obelisk-8cc32bc9ca37" target="_blank">Obelisk</a> consensus mechanism, every token supported by Fiber will be fundamentally isolated from others such that they will never impact one another regarding network stability, security, or throughput.  Additionally, through the Skycoin <a href="https://medium.com/skycoin/skycoin-coin-hours-f537fa7ae614" target="_blank">Coin Hour</a> system, every project that leverages Fiber will advance the entire Skycoin platform forward, without hindering the existing platform operations.  Fiber creates an unprecedented level of symbiosis between projects while maintaining enough isolation such that no one tokens can negatively impact the remainder of the network.',

It is fundamentally naive to assume that one set of rules or operations will fulfill the requirements of a wide range of projects, meaning adaptability is the most crucial factor of a blockchain platform that aims to successfully scale both vertically and laterally.',
